speleodigest is a mailing list that delivers one very old caving article to you once a week.

Our content is pulled from [Speleo Digest](https://caves.org/pub/speleodigest/history.shtml), an annual project operated by the National Speleological Society from 1988 to 2003. Each year, the Speleo Digest project published one book which contains selected material from grotto newsletters of a given year, selected by a volunteer editor on the basis of entertainment or permanent reference value.
